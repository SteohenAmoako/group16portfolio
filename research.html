                 <h2>Discontinuous Galerkin Methods</h2>
                 <p>Unlike traditional Continuous Galerkin 
                    (cG) methods that are conforming, the 
                    Discontinuous Galerkin (dG) method works 
                    over a trial space of functions that are only 
                    piecewise continuous, and thus often comprise more 
                    inclusive function spaces than the finite-dimensional 
                    inner product subspaces utilized in conforming methods. 
                    dG schemes are complex in their implementations and have 
                    several applications in hyperbolic problems.</p>

                <h2>Isogeometric Analysis </h2>
                <p>As a recently developed computational approach, it offers 
                    the possibility of integrating finite element analysis 
                    (FEA) into conventional NURBS-based Computer Aided Design 
                    (CAD ) tools. Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) allows models to 
                    be designed, tested and adjusted in one go, using a common 
                    data set. The fundamental theories have been presented by 
                    Hughes et al. (2005) and competes strongly with FEM in several 
                    applications especially because it is an High Order scheme. </p>

            <h2>Optimal Control Methods</h2>
            <p>Here, so far, we have studied and analyzed the optimal control of 
                Mathematical epidemiology models. By using sensitivity analysis, 
                we are also able to determine the economic value of each strategy 
                used in the control. </p>

                 <h2>Surface Partial Differential Equations </h2>
                 <p>The discretization of PDEs on surfaces started with the 
                    use of surface finite elements to compute solutions to the 
                    Poisson problem for the Laplaceâ€“Beltrami operator on a curved 
                    surface proposed and analysed in Dziuk (find paper here). 
                    The important concept is the use of triangulated surfaces on 
                    which finite element spaces are constructed and then used in 
                    variational formulations of surface PDEs using surface gradients. 
                    My research interest involves using Isogeometric Analysis 
                    (IgA) which have better approximation properties especially 
                    with regards to representation of surfaces for discretization. </p>

                <h2> Space-Time Methods</h2>
                <p>This approach to discretizing time-dependent 
                    problems is considered to be a natural way of numerical discretization 
                    for problems requiring deforming and moving meshes. The space-time schemes 
                    allow for discretization in time and space simultaneously and are also applicable 
                    even for unstructured meshes. Here, the time variable is also considered as just 
                    another spatial variable. In this sense, the time derivative acts as a strong convection 
                    term in the direction of the new spatial variable. In this direction, 
                    we use Isogeometric Analysis (IGA) and FEM to present new ideas on solving 
                    time-dependent problems.</p>

            <p>The understanding of the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases has been well-studied

                the understanding of the underlying mechanisms which influence the spread of
